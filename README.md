For the next step : 

- Add a front end design for mobile (react native)
- Add more YearnFinance Token
- Solve the issue : if we send dai token directly to the address of the walle smart contract, it will not kow that it receive dai so the token will stay there instead of being invest. So creat a nodejs script to checkout everyday if we have dai token in the wallet if its its true it call the save function to invest in YearFinance Protocol
- Add a swap function
